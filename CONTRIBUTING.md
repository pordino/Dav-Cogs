Heyo, you seem to be interested in contributing to my cogs. That's awesome! \

# Basics
If you've never contributed to a GitHub repository before, please check out [this guide](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) on "How to make a PR". Don't worry, it's not difficult at all.

# Step by step
1. [Fork](https://github.com/Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs/fork) this repository.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local drive. ``git clone [your_URL]``

3. Make the changes using your favourite text editor or IDE. I recommend [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the python extension.

4. Commit the changes (via VSC or git). ``git commit -m "My change"``

5. Push the changes (via VSC or git). ``git push``

6. Open a new [pull request](https://github.com/Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs/compare) and describe your changes.

7. Await a reply.

8. Success.

# Some simple rules

1. Ensure cross compatibility for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

2. Ensure all Python features used in contributions exist and work in Python 3.8.1 and above.

3. Create any issues for new features you'd like to implement and explain why this feature is useful to everyone and not just you personally.

4. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/).

# What do you need help with?

Want to help out but not sure what to do? \
Take a look at the open issues. \
Issues marked with the ``good first issue`` label are relatively easy and good for beginners.
Issues marked with the ``help wanted`` label are complex or I haven't had the time or motivation to do them yet. These are for medium to advanced contributors.

Generally any help is appreciated. Wether it is fixing up my terrible spelling or repairing a broken feature, I am thankful for **all** of your contributions.
