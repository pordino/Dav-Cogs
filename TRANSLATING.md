# Translation guide.

To help translate the cogs in this repo, you need to first create a fork and clone the repository to your computer. \
Next, you will need to download a program to create the translation. An example is [POedit](https://poedit.net/). Using a program like this, you can now open the ``messages.pot`` file located in the ``locales`` directory of every cog. You can now start translating. Once you are done translating, save the file as ``language-CODE.po`` where "language-CODE" is the language code for your country and language. Every cog includes an example for german translations. \
Once you have created the .po file upload it to your fork of the repository and create a [pull-request](https://github.com/Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs/compare).

```py
Note: Cogs that don't have a "locales" direcotry don't have translation support.
```
